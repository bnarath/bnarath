# Hey there !!

<p>

Iâ€™m Bincy Narath, a Data Scientist / Machine Learning Engineer with experience in developing and deploying machine learning and deep learning solutions. My work spans areas like Recommender Systems, Graph Neural Networks, NLP, and Generative AI, with a focus on translating research into practical applications.

My interest in mathematics, algorithms, and problem-solving drives me to balance technical understanding with real-world usability. Bringing a product from inception to production is a rewarding process, and continuous optimization remains a key challenge I enjoy tackling. I strive to maintain this balance between research and engineering in my work.

Before entering the ML field, I gained experience in Telecom, Networking, and Cloud Infrastructure, which helped me develop strong engineering, programming, and design-thinking skills for end-to-end problem-solving. I believe AI and machine learning are essential tools for bridging the gap between the impossible and the possible, with the potential to make a significant impact on society.

Beyond my professional interests, I enjoy fitness, yoga, and boxing. For me, life is all about embracing change and enjoying the process!

Thanks for stopping by! :heart:
